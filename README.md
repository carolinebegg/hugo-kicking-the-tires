## CIS 3500 Homework #1

PART III: Practice Using Hugo (hugo-kicking-the-tires)

Summary of PART III Tasks + Additional Practice

1. Set up public hugo-kicking-the-tires repository, cloned it to my computer, and added .gitignore file
2. Following instructions in Chapter 1 to set up the base Hugo site
3. Added some of my own creativity to the base framework outlined in the Chapter 1 instructions
4. Practiced staging and committing all of my changes

In addition to the basic structure given in the set up instructions in Chapter 1, I wanted to play around with adding some more content to the hugo-kicking-the-tires site. Thus, I filled in more of the content, creating a fuller resume section (including my education, CIS classes I've taken, and some projects that I've worked on). Additionally, I filled in the About page with a short biography of myself, and also included my contact information on the Conact page.

Beyond just adding more content, I used these additions as a way to experiment with different features of this program, such as by mixing different header and text settings in the .md files, modifying the default page setup, and experimenting with draft settings.
