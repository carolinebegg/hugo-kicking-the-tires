My Biography

My name is Caroline Begg, and I am a sophomore in the M&T program (dual degree between Wharton and Penn Engineering) studying CIS and Finance/Business Analytics. I am originally from Trumbull, CT. At home, I live with my parents and my four pets (two dogs and two cats!); my older sister Kay lives in Dallas, TX.

Outside of the classroom, I am super involved in lots of different ways on campus, including academic, social, and preprofessional clubs, and also am passionate about philanthrophy work to give back to the local Philly community.

In my free time, I love to exercise, spent time with my friends, and explore new coffee shops and restuarants around the city!
