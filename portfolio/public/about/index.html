        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>My name is Caroline Begg, and I am a sophomore in the M&amp;T program (dual degree between Wharton and Penn Engineering) studying CIS and Finance/Business Analytics. I am originally from Trumbull, CT. At home, I live with my parents and my four pets (two dogs and two cats!); my older sister Kay lives in Dallas, TX.</p>
<p>Outside of the classroom, I am super involved in lots of different ways on campus, including academic, social, and preprofessional clubs, and also am passionate about philanthrophy work to give back to the local Philly community.</p>
<p>In my free time, I love to exercise, spent time with my friends, and explore new coffee shops and restuarants around the city!</p>
